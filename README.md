# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Top-Gun-Marverick-movie-Reviews
In this project firstly we analysis the past reviews and predict the sentiment of reviews as positive or negative.

# Introduction-

- It is a Natural Language Processing Problem where Sentiment Analysis is done by Classifying the Positive tweets from negative tweets by machine learning models for classification, text mining, text analysis, data analysis and data visualization.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a hotbed of research in data science these days and one of the most common applications of NLP is sentiment analysis. From opinion polls to creating entire marketing strategies, this domain has completely reshaped the way businesses work, which is why this is an area every data scientist must be familiar with.
- We will do so by following a sequence of steps needed to solve a general sentiment analysis problem. We will start with preprocessing and cleaning of the raw text of the reviews. Then we will explore the cleaned text and try to get some intuition about the context of the reviews. After that, we will extract numerical features from the data and finally use these feature sets to train models and identify the sentiments of the reviews.

# Understand the Problem Statement-

- Formally, given a training sample of reviews and labels, where label ‘1’ denotes the review is positive and label ‘0’ denotes the review is negative, our objective is to predict the labels on the given test dataset.

# End Of Project What We Have Learn

- In this article, we learned how to approach a sentiment analysis problem. We started with preprocessing and exploration of data. Then we extracted features from the cleaned text using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF. Finally, we were able to build a couple of models using both the feature sets to classify the reviews.
